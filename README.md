# know_the_country
<p>This app allows us to search any existing country and shows us some basic details of it.</p>
<p>To make this possible the application requires some AJAX request to be made and get the data from the promise using then() method.</p>
<p>To make asynchronous AJAX calls we can also use async await, however for this small application I have used then(), catch() and finally() methods.</p>
